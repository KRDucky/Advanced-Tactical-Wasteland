+ For mission makers:

BTK_CargoDrop_ObjectLoaded - This detects whenever a object is loaded in.
Sample:
_YourVariable = YOUROBJECT getVariable "BTK_CargoDrop_ObjectLoaded";
_YourVariable = true; // means the object has been loaded in.

BTK_CargoDrop_TransporterLoaded - This detects whenever a transporter contains cargo.
Sample:
_YourVariable = YOUROBJECT getVariable "BTK_CargoDrop_TransporterLoaded";

Both are LOCAL ONLY ! See Demo mission files for more details!
